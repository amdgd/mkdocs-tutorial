Installing and Theming using MkDocs SSG

#Overview
MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

##Host anywhere
MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages, Amazon S3, or anywhere else you choose.

##Great themes available
There's a stack of good looking themes available for MkDocs. Choose between the built in themes: mkdocs and readthedocs, select one of the 3rd party themes in the MkDocs wiki, or build your own.

##Preview your site as you work
The built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you're writing it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save your changes.

##Easy to customize
Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing the theme.
